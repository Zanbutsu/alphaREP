    <h1>My File in Cloud Object Storage</h1>
<p></p>
<p>I just learned how to work with Cloud Object Storage, including -</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Creating Buckets</li>
    <li>Adding Objects to them</li>
    <li>and Sharing them with others</li>
</ul>
<p> - in this Introduction to Cloud course from IBM.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>I am supposed to edit this in some way, and this line fulfills that purpose.</li>
	<li>Same as you (I guess), I actually wish this course is the harbinger of a new kind of life for myself more in line with human dignity and capabilities.</li>
</ul>
 <h1>So I wish upon you all the blessings of this world, and hope you wish me back!<h1>
